How to record any song from Apple Music loselessly and add to your personal collection

Download and install “Background Music” from [Here](https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic)

Then open QuickTime Player and select “new audio recording” hit the little drop down arrow and select “Background music” (you will only need to do this step once unless you change it later)

Next you’ll want to open Apple Music and play the song you want to save, pause it immediately and move the slider back to the beginning to be sure

Finally run the savemusic.scpt in this repository and enjoy your music! It will save everything in the format of Artist/Album/song and put the album art in the appropriate folder, this will all be automatically placed in downloads but you can change that if you want

Note: if you get any popups about the script needing permissions just allow them all and hit run again(also should only happen once)
